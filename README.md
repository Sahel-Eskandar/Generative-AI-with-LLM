# Generative AI with Large Language Models

This repository presents applied use cases and experiments with Generative AI powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).  
The objective is to provide AI/ML practitioners with practical insights into leveraging LLMs for tasks such as:

- Natural language understanding and generation  
- Code synthesis and automation  
- Information retrieval and summarization  
- Multi-modal reasoning (text, data, and beyond)  
- Domain-specific fine-tuning and evaluation  

Each use case is designed to bridge theory with implementation, showcasing best practices, challenges, and opportunities in deploying LLMs in real-world workflows.
